                            Iâ€™m a very ambitious front-end developer looking to work with the latest

                            technologies on challenging and diverse projects. I am naturally curious, and always eager to learn more and take on new

                            challenges. I enjoy

                            I'm quietly confident, naturally curious, and perpetually working on
                            improving my chops one design problem at a time.

                            If I need to define myself in one sentence that would be a family

                            person, father of a beautiful daughter, a sports fanatic,

                            photography enthusiast, and tech-obsessed!!!

                            I'm Corey Coleman, a Freelance Front-end developer. I'm a weird guy who likes making weird things with web technologies.
                            I like to resolve design problems, create smart user interface and imagine useful interaction, developing rich web experiences & web applications.
                            When not working or futzing around with code, I study how to escape from University. Actually for hire.
