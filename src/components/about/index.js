                        I'm Corey Coleman, a Freelance Front-end developer. I'm a weird guy who likes making weird things with web technologies. I like to resolve design problems, create smart user interface and imagine useful interaction, developing rich web experiences & web applications. When not working or futzing around with code, I study how to escape from University. Actually for hire.
